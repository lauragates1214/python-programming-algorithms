**Lab and Problem Sets for Python**<br>
*from Harvardx's Professional Certificate in Computer Science for Python Programming<br>
CS50x Introduction to Computer Science & CS50P Introduction to Python Programming*
<br><br>
This repository contains the lab and a selection of problem sets for Python that I've completed as part of my professional certificate program through Harvardx.
<br><br>

Most of the programs were written fully by me based on the lab/problem set prompt. Where CS50 has included pre-existing code (in World Cup and DNA), my contributions to the code are commented with **LauraPG**, and outlined under implementation details below. I've listed the assignments in reverse order of completion.

**CS50x Lab 6: World Cup**<br>
*Simulates a sports tournament.*
<br><br>
Implementation details for my contribution to code:     
- reads team data from csv file provided in command line into memory as dictionaries and appends to list, with input validation
- simulates a tournament, repeatedly simulating rounds until left with one team.
<br><br>

**CS50x Problem Set 6: DNA**<br>
*Identifies a person based on their DNA.*
<br><br>
Implementation details for my contribution to code:   
- requires as its first command-line argument the name of a CSV file containing the STR counts for a list of individuals and as its second command-line argument the name of a text file containing the DNA sequence to identify, with input validation
- opens csv file and DNA sequence and reads contents into memory
- if the DNA STR counts match exactly with any of the individuals in the CSV file, prints out the name of the matching individual.

**CS50x Problem Set 6: Credit**<br>
*Prompts the user for a credit card number, then uses Luhn's algorithm to validate the card number as Visa, MasterCard, American Express or invalid.*<br>
I also wrote Credit in C as part of CS50x Problem Set 1 (see repository Harvard-CS50-labs-problemsets-C).
<br><br>

**CS50x Problem Set 6: Cash**<br>
*Prompts the user for the number of cents that a customer is owed and then prints the smallest number of coins with which that change can be made.*<br>
I also wrote Cash in C as part of CS50x Problem Set 1 (see repository Harvard-CS50-labs-problemsets-C).
<br><br>

**CS50x Problem Set 6: Mario More**<br>
*Prints a full pyramid, with empty column in middle, using # based on user's integer input, with input validation.*<br>
I also wrote Mario More in C as part of CS50x Problem Set 1 (see repository Harvard-CS50-labs-problemsets-C).
<br><br>

**CS50x Problem Set 6: Mario Less**  
*Prints a half pyramid using # based on user's integer input, with input validation.*<br>
I also wrote Mario Less in C as part of CS50x Problem Set 1 (see repository Harvard-CS50-labs-problemsets-C).
<br><br>

**CS50P Problem Set 3: Felipe's Taqueria**
*Enables a user to place an order, validates inputs against a menu dictionary, and displays the total cost of all items inputted thus far, until the user inputs control-d.*
<br><br>

**CS50P Problem Set 3: Outdated**<br>
*Prompts the user for a date, Anno Domini, in MM-DD-YYYY order, formatted like 9/8/1636 or September 8, 1636, with validation checks. It then outputs that same date in YYYY-MM-DD format.*
<br><br>

**CS50P Problem Set 3: Grocery List**<br>
*Prompts the user for grocery list items, one per line, until the user inputs control-d. It then outputs the grocery list in all uppercase, sorted alphabetically by item, prefixing each line with the number of times the user inputted that item.*
<br><br>

**CS50P Problem Set 2: Vanity Plates**<br>
*Validates a vanity plate entered by the user against four Massachusettes vanity plate requirements.*
<br><br>

**CS50P Problem Set 2: Just setting up my twttr**<br>
*Prompts the user for a text input then returns it stripped of all vowels.*
<br><br>

**CS50P Problem Set 1: Meal Time**<br>
*Prompts the user for a time of day, supporting both 12-hour and 24-hour inputs via a.m./p.m. conversion, and returns what meal time it is.*
ion returns true if every remaining candidate has same number of votes, otherwise false
