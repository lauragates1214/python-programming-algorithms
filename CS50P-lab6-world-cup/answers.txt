Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: England actually comes second, US third (not the other way around);
Cameroon and Nigeria come last, with China and Spain close to equal just above them (Cameroon and Nigeria don't even appear in shorter simulations, and China is
in middle of list)

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: 1000 (the first and last teams up to 3-4 are in place)
